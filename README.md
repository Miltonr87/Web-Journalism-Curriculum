Web Journalism Curriculum

Web Page created and written in HTML & CSS from scratch with responsive effects. The idea here is to start from the raw concept to develop more code skills and organization before moving on to Flexbox, Grid and Bootstrap technologies... In this case, a curriculum website that includes my activities as a journalist in places that I worked before.
