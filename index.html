                <h2> Front-End Web Developer | Web Journalist </h2> 
                <br>
                <p> Graduated in journalism 2010 from the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil, I always focused on my career in communication, new technologies and the potential embraced by the web over past 10 years. I diversified my career by combining writing skills with the technical accuracy provided by the quality of a reporter. </p> 
                <br>
                <p> As a journalist, I worked from the 2 majors industries of my city Macei√≥, Alagoas. I also produced, in parallel, web content for other sites about North American Sports for Brazilians, special beers and, later, as a part of the international OneVox Creative Solutions team.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Today, I dedicate myself into a new "writing" type... An old passion that always follow me in all my jobs as web journalist. Now I turned myself into a web development and I search to solidify more and more my coding skills. </p>
